//! There are multiple models that can be used to track state for both [LogEvents](crate::logs::LogEvent) and
//! [JournalEvents](crate::journal::JournalEvent). The most top-level models that track the most are:
//!
//! - [GameState](crate::state::GameState) is used for when you want to track the state of an Elite: Dangerous installation.
//!   It automatically differentiates between different commanders if the installation happens to
//!   contain logs for multiple accounts.
//! - [LogState](crate::state::LogState) acts a lot like GameState, but *does not* differentiate between different
//!   commanders and treats everything as a single state. You might use this for example when
//!   processing logs where the specific commander does not matter.
//! - [JournalState](crate::state::JournalState) is used in conjunction with a
//!   [LiveJournalDirReader](crate::journal::blocking::LiveJournalDirReader) to combine log
//!   information with live information from the various JSON files that the game updates
//!   periodically.
